# SNHU_Capstone
SNHU Capstone Portfolio

There are three files each related to my final project for SNHU computer science capstone. 

There are three programs within this repository - showing different computer science abilities. 
1. Software Design and Engineering - Transfer a project into a different language
2. Algorithms and Data Structures - Improve efficiency
3. Databases - Create a MongoDB interface with HTML/JavaScript

## Milestone 2 (Software Design and Engineering) information: 
The Milestone 2 folder contains the program for the Milestone 2 project and part 1 of the final project. 
There are two folders within this directory; one has the old Java program, and one has the converted Python program.
The actual submission can be found in the NewCode folder. This code functions very similarly to the Java project. The
main difference is the MD5 hash function is quite a bit different in Python; and has a generally easier method than the
standard way in Java. I added a few improvements to this project; including better login functionality, MD5 password
checking, and improved read speeds. 

**The .txt files are required for program functionality!**

## Milestone 3 (Algorithms and Data Structures) information: 
The Milestone 3 folder contains the program for the Milestone 3 project and part 2 of the final project. 
There are two folders within this directory as well; OriginalCode contains the C++ source code, .hpp, and Excel data. 
NewCode contains the actual submission. This program is based off the C++ program within the directory. It uses a combination
of two data structures created in C++ (singly linked list and binary tree). The C++ program only contains the linked list 
data structure. I initially did not plan to convert this program to Python, but as Python is my favorite language, I believed
it would be beneficial to practice my skills more in the language. In the Python program, a few different traversal algorithms (3) 
are used for the binary tree while only one (1) is used for the linked list. The program also allows for an Excel sheet
to be read and be used in the data structures, a similar concept to the C++ file. The Excel file is different from the one in 
the C++ program; containing different data and variables.

**Please use the included .xlsx file for using the program!**

## Milestone 4 (Databases) information: 
The Milestone 4 folder contains the MongoDB and Javascript database. I decided to do a restful API with CRUD 
operations for this project. I have the most difficult time with databases so I struggled a bit with this
project. I followed a video guide for creating most of the server and implementing different packages such as
mongoose, express, and node. The main project contains a server which has a few different models. The user is able to 
use CRUD operations to create, read (get), update, and delete documents from the database. The database uses MongoDB
to hold the information, including index, schema, and documents. Database is ran on Local Host - port 3000.
This project is based off of a guide from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgTGADljAeg&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified

**There are quite a few files and required setups for this project so it may be difficult to test**
