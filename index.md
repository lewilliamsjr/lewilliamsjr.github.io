## Self - Assessment: 

#### Overview:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many different aspects to my programming projects that I believe showcase my strengths in the computer science industry. I think to start, converting a program from Java to Python was a good way of showing my ability to functionally use two different languages. I think that code conversions can be extremely useful in the computer science industry, and this helped to showcase my ability. The data structures and algorithms project were based off of two C++ programs that contained a parsing function, and also used binary trees and linked lists. I decided to implement these data structures and put them into a new program in Python. This new project had many improvements from the original, primarily pertaining to speed and how the menu functions work. I think this project showcases my understanding of object-oriented programming and algorithms, including traversal methods and search options. Lastly, the database I created in MongoDB helped to show my understanding of databases and how to correctly implement a restful API with CRUD operations. Although I do not plan on being a database administrator, having an understanding is important. 
 
#### Team Environments:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to collaborating in a team environment, I believe that I learned the most from using Git. I have never used Git before, so learning how to commit, pull, and set up a dashboard helped me to better understand it. I think that this is the primary source of team environments and collaboration. Since multiple people will be uploading code to Git using different branches, pull requests, and other methods. I think that knowing how to use Git is particularly important for any team environment. The same holds true for any repository. 

#### Communicating to Stakeholders:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think that my projects directly communicate with stakeholders, but I believe what I have written about them can. I think the most important thing is that I had a clear derivative for each of my programs and was able to closely meet those goals. Although some of them may have ended different in the final deployment; they follow their initial goals closely. It is important when communicating to stake holders that you can establish what your project will do, how it can be implemented, and how you will complete the project. I think if I were told to explain to a stakeholder how I would correctly implement a data structure I could show them something such as the work in my Milestone three project. 

#### Data Structures and Algorithms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data structures and algorithms were the primary focus of my second artifact. I think that I was able to convey my understanding of data structures in this artifact pretty well. I used both a singly linked list and a binary tree for the data structures. Each of these methods hold data in different ways. I believe having two data structures instead of one was beneficial to showing my ability of creating data structures. I also used a few different traversal methods for these data structures. These algorithms allow for traversing through the data structures at a quick efficiency, along with searching through the linked list correctly. Although the algorithms are fairly simple, I believe I implemented them pretty well in conjunction with the .xlsl files and reading and writing included with Pandas. Data structures and algorithms are the backbone to a large amount of software engineering, and I believe I was able to correctly convey my skill in these categories.

#### Software Engineering and Databases
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software engineering is the focus of all of the projects really. Although, the focus of converting Java to Python was my main concentration for this objective. I also believe I showed my software engineering skills in the data structures program and the database. Converting the Java program to Python was a bit challenging but I believe I was able to do this correctly and even make improvements upon the original code. The database program made use of many different frameworks and packages; all of which led to a functional database in MongoDB. Implementing some more abstract things too such as the Ubuntu Bash shell helped to make this database perform correctly. I think I struggled with the database project the most, but it was able to show that I at least have a grasp on databases and how to correctly implement them into a project.

#### Reason for Inclusion: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose the three artifacts I did since I believe they show different skills in the computer science industry. The code conversion focuses on my software engineering and language skills. The data structures focus primarily on my object-oriented programming skills. Lastly, the database focuses on my understanding of how to create and implement a database. Although these programs do not exactly function together, they all show separate skills that I think are extremely useful when programming. Overall, I believe I was able to convey my skills and accurately portray them on my portfolio and am looking forward to what the future brings for me with software engineering.

## Milestone 2 - Software Design and Engineering
### Transfer a project into a different language 

#### Artifact explanation:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My artifact for milestone two is based off of a final project from my IT-145 course. The project is a Java program that implements a ‘log in’ system along with an MD5 password hashing function. I created this artifact quite awhile ago initially as it was one of my earlier programming classes at SNHU. The artifact that is included in my portfolio is the same essential program but converted into Python. The converted Python code has some changes made to it but is a similarly functioning program. 

#### Reason for inclusion in portfolio:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I included this artifact as I believed converting a program from one language to another is a valuable skill in the computer science industry. Python is my preferred language; and although I have not done too much work with it, I found this inclusion to be beneficial to my learning and skill. I chose to convert this program primarily due to me believing I could convert it and keep it pretty identical to the initial code. Although, I did decide to add some improvements to the functionality. One of these improvements was using lists to store pre-determined passwords in a separate function. In the original Java code, I had done this with a pretty lengthy comparison statement. I also had most of the comparisons done within the main function. I decided it would be better to implement these comparisons into separate functions in the Python version.

#### What the program does: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The general idea of the program is to open a .txt file based on the user’s login information and print it out to the user. The login information contains a user type, a username, and a user password. The password and username are inputted while the type is assigned in the program based on the user’s credentials. The user’s type is passed along with the password to an MD5 conversion function. There is a library in Python that allows for an easy MD5 conversion, which is what I used. The hashed password is then passed with the type and compared to determine which file is opened. Once the file is opened it is printed to the screen containing the information. The user can then opt to logout of the system or return to the main menu. 

#### Reaching goals:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My main goal with this artifact was to show my ability to convert one piece of code to another language. I also decided I could make some minor improvements and clean the code up a bit. My main course outcome with this project was to show innovative skills and techniques for accomplishing goals. In this case the innovative techniques would be converting the language. I believe this is a good skill to have and something I would like to be able to do efficiently. Converting a program from one language to another can align with specific goals in the industry; such as a company deciding to switch their programs into a different language. This can also be appliable for changing versions of code, such as switching from Python 2.X to Python 3.X. I think another important technique could possibly be taking advantage of different libraries and packages; particularly for the MD5 hashing. I also included some unit testing for this program, which I believe is another important skill to have. I have not done unit tests in Python before, so they are pretty simplistic; but accomplish the testing I needed.
   

#### What I learned: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned a few things from converting this artifact from Java to Python. One of those things is how different but also similar these languages can be. Things tend to be a bit more simplified in Python but implementing some features can be a bit more confusing than in Java. Converting a program from one language to another is something I have never done before, so it was initially a bit challenging. The overall code though is not that complex, so the main challenge came from brushing up on my Python knowledge and finding ways to implement certain functions. I learned that there are quite a few things that can be done when it comes to converting programs. Particularly, it is a bit more open with what you can do with a converted program. There were some changes I made that improved functionality and also made the code cleaner and easier to understand. Overall, I found it fun and interesting to convert my Java program to Python and could see myself learning how to do this better, along with learning how to effectively use two languages at once.

## Milestone Three - Data Structures and Algorithms:
### Implement Data Structures and Algorithms from C++ into Python

#### Artifact Selection:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My artifact for milestone three is an amalgamation of two different C++ data structure programs that is also converted into Python. These C++ programs are from my CS-260 class that I took a few semesters ago. I know that for my first artifact I decided to do a Python conversion, but I decided to do the same thing here. I was having trouble coming up with ways to improve the already implemented data structures, as they were already operating pretty quickly with their respective algorithms. I instead decided that it would be more beneficial to me to practice doing algorithms and data structures in Python. C++ is a much more object-oriented language than Python is, but after quite a bit of research and development I was able to implement some of the data structures from C++ into a Python project. 

#### Options:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the main things that I had to consider was if I wanted to simply make improvements to the program in C++ or to convert it into a Python project as well. Technically the Python project is two C++ projects combined. To me, the overall goal of the second artifact was to show knowledge and capability of creating data structures and using algorithms to traverse or access them. My original C++ projects I had some trouble with due to them not functioning up to speed and having some errors. I decided since Python is my language focus that I could attempt to convert some of these data structures into Python. 

#### Choices:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are quite a few components to this artifact that are different than the previous submission (milestone two). For one, this artifact makes use of the classes and class objects, which are essential for object-oriented programming in Python. There is also the inclusion of reading and writing to an Excel spreadsheet. The original code in C++ used a csv parser to write and read to a csv file. In the case of Python, I decided to use an Excel spreadsheet while using a few different packages and libraries to support the functionality. The Excel spreadsheet contains two categories: fruits and amounts. These do not have any specific meaning but are there primarily for testing. This spreadsheet data can be written to within the program, along with having its data pulled into the data structures. Although, the implemented functionality of this (with data structures) is limited. 


#### Data Structures and Traversal: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two primary data structures used in this program are a singly linked list and a binary tree. The singly linked list only contains one append method, which is to the front. The singly linked lists use nodes to traverse through the data elements; this is done by setting the pointer to the following node. The binary tree is pretty simple in that a total of ten nodes can be added to the root within the function (user inputted). The binary tree contains the data, left pointer, and right pointer. These pointers connect to each child (branch) on either side of the tree. The nodes are created by comparing the value of the node to the value of the parent node (higher branch). There are a few pretty standard ways to implement a binary tree in Python, so I used those methods. I also decided to include three methods of binary tree traversal, which are pre-order, in-order, and post-order. An empty list is used for the traversal in each method, which holds either the left node, right node, or parent node. This is repeated until each node has been passed through. One thing to note is how different pointers function in Python compared to C++. In C++ they are much more complex, particularly dealing with memory allocation. In Python they are a bit more ‘pre-determined’ and easier to implement for these data structures. 


#### Course Requirements: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that this program meets the course requirements in that innovative skills and techniques are used for accomplishing goals. My goal was being able to correctly implement algorithms and data structures along with having functionality to write and read from an Excel spreadsheet. I think that I was able to achieve these things in fairly intuitive ways and with keeping the code clean. One of the problems with the C++ code was how messy and complex the code was originally. I believe that the program also solves logic problems involving algorithms and data structures. For example, one of the functions allows for the user to enter 10 objects (data) into a binary tree. These objects create new nodes which are traversed according to the user’s choice. This will change how the binary tree is displayed and show a few different ways of traversing with algorithms. Using multiple libraries such as Pandas for reading Excel data and openpyxl for writing to Excel data can also be considered an intuitive way to reach my goal in the program. By using these libraries, I was able to list the excel data cleanly and allow users to add their own data. 


#### Challenges and What I Learned: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found this artifact much more challenging than the previous milestone’s. One of the reasons for this was correctly implementing the classes. I had to look through quite a few recourses to get a correct way of implementing them with data structures. I also had some challenges using Pandas correctly and had to install some specific packages to get the Excel data to function correctly. I believe this would have been easier with a csv file but I wanted to use a direct xlsx file type. Another challenge was attempting to do the data structures similarly to the C++ program. I think the most important thing for me from this milestone is that I was able to learn some object-oriented programming in Python. This is a subject I never really worked on in Python, so it was especially useful for me to be able to implement this in a language I prefer. Overall, I think there was a few more instances of data structures I could probably have used. I also wish that I was able to better implement the Excel data into the data structures, but I think what I have is a good bases and shows at least an understanding of the functionality of data structures and sort algorithms.

#### Here are some snippits from my Python project:

#### Classes:
```python

# Class for linked list - Creates node containing head and next pointer

class node:
    def __init__(self, data=None):  # 'Constructor'
        self.data = data
        self.next = None


# Linked list class - Contains linked list print and add node
# Nodes are added to the front of the list vs the back
# There is only one traversal method for this data structure

class linkedList:
    def __init__(self):  # 'Constructor'
        self.head = node()  # head node
        self.tail = None  # Tail set to none
        self.length = 0  # Length 0

    # Add node to the front of the linked list

    def addNodeF(self, newData):
        newNode = node(newData)

        # New node is added to the head of the list

        newNode.next = self.head
        self.head = newNode

    # For printing linked lit

    def printList(self):
        pn = self.head  # set head
        while pn:
            print(pn.data)  # print data
            pn = pn.next  # set to next


# Class for binary tree and search - Binary tree search based on code

class treeNode:
    def __init__(self, data=None):  # data set to none initial* -- 'Constructor'
        self.data = data
        self.left = None  # left branch
        self.right = None  # right branch

    # Add the tree - creates tree based on nodes left / right

    def addTree(self, data=None):
        if data == self.data:
            return

        # go left branches (child)

        if data < self.data:
            if self.left is None:
                self.left = treeNode(data)
            else:
                self.left.addTree(data)

        # go right branches (child)

        else:
            if self.right is None:
                self.right = treeNode(data)
            else:
                self.right.addTree(data)
                    # Pre order traversal

    def traversal(self, root=None):
        elements = []  # list object for elements
        if root:
            elements.append(root.data)  # current node value
            elements += self.traversal(root.left)  # traverse left branch from root
            elements += self.traversal(root.right)  # traverse right branch from root

        return elements  # Returns elements[]

    # Post (reverse) order traversal

    def postTraversal(self, root=None):
        elements = []
        if root:
            elements = self.postTraversal(root.left)  # ""
            elements += self.postTraversal(root.right)  # ""
            elements.append(root.data)

        return elements

    # In order traversal - for

    def inTraversal(self, root=None):
        elements = []
        if root:
            elements = self.inTraversal(root.left)  # ""
            elements.append(root.data)
            elements += self.inTraversal(root.right)  # ""

        return elements
```

#### Example of Traversal in Binary Tree:
```python
# Inverse traversal tree function

def userTreeSearchIn():
    menuLoop = True
    root = treeNode("Root")  # Assign root node to s, "Root"

    while menuLoop is True:  # loop for menu

        print("Tree root is word 'Root' - Branches are created alphabetically")
        print("Would you like to add a new leaf? (y/n)")
        yesNo = input()

        if yesNo in ["y", "Y"]:

            # Loop for user to enter 10 'objects' which will be put into the binary tree

            print("Enter data (10 objects): ")
            for i in range(10):
                tree = raw_input()
                root.addTree(tree)

            print("\n")
            print(root.inTraversal(root), "\n")  # Traversal for printing tree
            menuLoop = False  # Ends menu loop

        elif yesNo in ["n", "N"]:
            menuLoop = False  # Ends menu loop

        else:
            print("Error, please enter y or n\n")
            continue  # loop

```

#### Example of Singly Linked List Search:

```python

def listSearch(fruitData, amountData):
    menuLoop = True
    fruits = fruitData
    amounts = amountData
    lst1 = []  # List for fruit / amount

    list1 = linkedList()
    list1.head = node(fruits)  # head node is set to fruits (spreadsheet)
    n2 = node(" ")  # space
    n3 = node(amounts)  # node 3 is set to amounts

    # Set node / list order

    list1.head.next = n2
    n2.next = n3

    while menuLoop is True:  # loop

        print("Would you like to add a new node? (y/n)")
        yesNo = input()

        if yesNo in ["y", "Y"]:

            # Iterates ten times for user objects
            # These objects are saved to a list

            print("Enter new node: ")
            print("Enter 10 objects: ")
            for i in range(10):
                n4 = raw_input()  # Raw input in list
                lst1.append(n4)  # Appends list

            list1.addNodeF(lst1)  # Puts list into front node
            list1.printList()  # Displays linked list
            print("\n")
            menuLoop = False  # Ends loop

        elif yesNo in ["n", "N"]:
            list1.printList()  # Displays linked list w/o user data
            print("\n")
            menuLoop = False  # Ends loop

        else:
            print("Error, please enter y or n\n")
            continue  # loop


```

#### Working with .xlsx Files: 

```python

def addData():
    addLoop = True

    while addLoop:  # Loop for y/n selection

        print("Please type the name of a fruit: ")
        userFruit = input()  # Input for fruit

        print("Please type the amount of fruit: ")
        userAmount = input()  # Input for amount of fruit

        # Data frame for adding data to the excel spreadsheet
        df2 = pd.DataFrame({"Fruits": [userFruit], "Amounts": [userAmount]})

        # Setup writer using openpyxl
        writer = pd.ExcelWriter("FruitList.xlsx", engine="openpyxl")

        # Load spreadsheet as workbook
        writer.book = load_workbook("FruitList.xlsx")

        # Copies current loaded spreadsheet
        writer.sheets = dict((ws.title, ws) for ws in writer.book.worksheets)

        # Reads excel file
        reader = pd.read_excel(r'FruitList.xlsx')

        # Writes to the sheet; no index or header setting
        df2.to_excel(writer, index=False, header=False, startrow=len(reader) + 1)

        # Closes writer for other inputs
        writer.close()

        print("Data added\nAdd more data? (Y/N)")

        # Choice to add more data or return to menu
        yesNo = input()

        if yesNo in ['y', 'Y']:
            continue  # loop

        elif yesNo in ['n', 'N']:
            addLoop = False  # Ends loop
            main()  # main call
        else:
            print("Error, Returning to menu\n")
            break  # break loop
```

#### Using Pandas:
``` python

def main():
    # Import the data sheet from Excel (simple)

    # Pandas reads excel spreadsheet and assigns it to a variable

    df2 = pd.read_excel("FruitList.xlsx", header=None, names=["Fruits", "Amounts"])

    # The two main categories are converted to lists (Fruit and Amounts)
    # The variables are declared here to be passed to other functions

    fruits = df2["Fruits"].values.tolist()
    amounts = df2["Amounts"].values.tolist()
    print("Data Loaded!\n")

```

## Milestone 4 - Databases
#### Using MongoDB, Node.js, Mongoose, and Express for a restful API.

#### Artifact Selection:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My artifact for milestone four is a database created using MongoDB, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express, and Mongoose. There are quite a few components for this database, and I found this artifact the most challenging out of all of them. The database is primarily a restful API that uses the standard CRUD methods. MongoDB is used to store information such as indexes, documents, and models. The primary server and API code is done in JavaScript, while heavily making use of Mongoose and Express. One of the main things I wanted to do with this project was to integrate a web application. This proved a bit too challenging for me as my knowledge of databases is pretty limited. I decided that a restful API would be more manageable. 

#### Reason for Inclusion:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this artifact is an important inclusion to my portfolio due to databases being a quite common thing in the industry. Databases are commonly implemented in nearly any service; especially those hosted online. I think that correctly implementing a database is a good show of skill and how versatile my development skills can be. Since there was no previous artifact (I have no saved MongoDB code from previous classes), I had to create something from scratch. It is important to note that I followed a guide for the creation of my restful API (which is referenced in the code and in this paper). I think that the creation of this artifact shows that I understand the basics of a database and also API’s, along with properly implementing CRUD operations. 

#### What the code does:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The database is based off of creating documents that contain information about cats. The code allows for a user to insert a new document whenever they use the ‘route.rest’ file. There are other CRUD operations in this file as well, such as updating a particular document, reading all documents, finding a document based on id, or deleting a document. There is also a server file located within the artifact that contains most of the routing and hosting information. There is another file that contains the primary schema which holds the document information and variables for the cat. These variables are all strings that contain information such as the cat’s name, age, gender, and color. All of these documents are stored withing the MongoDB database, which runs off the local host. 

#### Course Requirements: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that I met the course requirements in that I showed the ability of manipulating data. This can be primarily seen with the CRUD operations in the program. I think that I also showed the use of innovative skills, such as using different frameworks and correctly implementing node.js. I think the primary course outcome is just showing that I understand how to create a database and fill it with documentation. This can be seen throughout the artifact. 


#### Challenges and What I Learned: 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said before, this was definitely the most challenging artifact for me. I believe that databases can be pretty complicated as they are quite different from regular programming. I am also not remarkably familiar with JavaScript or any of its frameworks. This definitely made implementing this project correctly a challenge. Most of the MongoDB creation is done automatically in the program files so this was a bit easier to implement. It also was a bit confusing get all the correct packages to work. One other thing was having to get the ubuntu bash shell onto windows and working correctly in visual studio. Overall, I found this project interesting and believe it has helped me with better understanding databases and their objectives.

```javascript
console.log(process.env.DATABASE_URL) // initialize the dotenv file

const env = require('dotenv').config()
const express = require("express"); // Initialize express (node.js)
const app = express();
const mongoose = require("mongoose"); // Initialize mongoose (used for MongoDB modeling)

// This uses mongoose to connect the the local host on port 3000
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URL, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
const db = mongoose.connection // Create database equal to the connecction 

app.use(express.json())

const aRouter = require("./animals/cats.js") // Router for cats information 
app.use("/cats", aRouter)

// Connects to port 3000 and alerts user to server start
app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server Started - SNHU Capstone"))
````

#### Models:
```javascript

const mongoose = require("mongoose")

//  Schema for containing cat information 
//  Cat name, age, color, gender, and eye color are stored here
const catschema = new mongoose.Schema({

    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true // Ensure that each type is required
    },

    age: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },

    color: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },

    gender: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },

    eyeColor: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },

})

module.exports = mongoose.model("Cats", catschema)

```

#### A Few CRUD Methods: 

``` javascript
router.get("/", async (req, res) => {
    
    const cats = await Cats.find()
    res.json(cats)
})

// Get specific - uses ID for get, returns one entry containing = id

router.get("/:id", getCats, (req, res) => {
    res.json(res.cat)

})

// Post a new 'cat' -> requires the different variables which are stored in the db 

router.post("/", async (req, res) => {
    const cats = new Cats({
        name: req.body.name,
        age: req.body.age,
        color: req.body.color,
        gender: req.body.gender,
        eyeColor: req.body.eyeColor
    })
    const newCat = await cats.save()
    res.json(newCat)
})
```
